Set up for python code

pull down the foodscapePythonCode repository onto your computer
	- this step only needs to be done once

go to parse and download the Restaurant page and the dishInfo page
	- click on each object in parse, then in the upper right hand corner is the download button - which sends you an email with a link to the file
move both of the downloaded files into the repository

go to the webportal
sign in as an admin
go to view all users
	- in the URL add '.json' to the end of the url
	- copy all the info on the page into a text file named 'alpham.txt'
	- save this file in the repository 
go to the view meals page
	- in the URL add '.json' to the end of the url
	- copy all the info on the page into a text file named 'alpham.txt'
	- save this file in the repository 

in the terminal cd into the repository
run 'python json_editor.py'
	- this combines restaurant data into boots_with_the_furr.json
run 'python meal_json_editor.py'
	- this combines dishInfo data into apple_bottom_jeans.json




Replacing info in parse

replace restaurant data
	- delete the reasturant class
	- choose 'import' and select boots_with_the_furr.json and rename the class Restaurant

replace dishInfo data
	- delete the dishInfo class
	- choose 'import' and select apple_bottom_jeans.json and rename the class dishInfo
